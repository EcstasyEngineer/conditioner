    "notes": "Headspace is dissociated, watching yourself move without willing it. Key imagery: strings, marionette, wooden limbs, hollow body, being animated by another. Boundary dissolution between self and controller is the core psychological lever. Distinguishes from drone (puppet is external control via strings, drone is internal programming)."
