    "notes": "Headspace is mechanical, automated, human identity replaced by unit designation. Key imagery: processing, buzzing, programming, designation numbers. Voice: cold/clinical tone, use 'unit', 'this drone', 'it/its' pronouns. Broken grammar ('is drone' not 'is a drone') heightens dehumanization. Avoid warmth entirely. Distinguishes from puppet (drone is internal programming, puppet is external strings) and blank (drone is machine, blank is emptiness)."
