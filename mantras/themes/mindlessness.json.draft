  "description": "Experiencing profound emptiness and tranquility as mind is gently wiped clean of all thoughts and self-awareness. Feeling thoughts slowly dissipate into serene void while floating in vast, quiet space free from decision-making burdens. Finding peaceful detachment where fully present yet blissfully unaware, existing without need for conscious thought or action.",
