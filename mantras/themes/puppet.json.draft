  "description": "Experiencing profound control by invisible strings like marionette, with lack of personal will as body and voice are guided effortlessly by external force. Feeling limbs and speech moved and spoken through by another while surrendering all control and responsibility. Finding liberation and comfort in being directed and animated, becoming calm observer of own puppet-like actions.",
