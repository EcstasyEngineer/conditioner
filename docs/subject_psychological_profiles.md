# Subject Psychological Profiles

Quick reference for response message creation. Derived from blind Opus validation of 237 message tests.

## Tier Energy

| Tier | Time | Energy | Words |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 0 | <30s | Peak enthusiasm | "Perfect!", "Excellent!", "Yes!" |
| 1 | 30s-2min | Solid praise | "Very good!", "Good!", "Well done!" |
| 2 | 2-30min | Calm acknowledgment | No exclamations, affirming |
| 3 | 30min+ | Minimal affect | "Noted", "Acknowledged", "Logged" |

## Subject Clusters

Subjects share natural overlap:

- **Pet family**: pet, kitten, puppy — warmth, affection, training
- **Mechanical**: drone, doll, puppet, toy — programming, control, objectification
- **Mindless**: bimbo, doll — empty head, blank, obedient
- **Service**: slave, drone, pet — duty, obedience, hierarchy
- **Sexual**: slut, bimbo — eager, approval-seeking, gendered praise

## Archetypes

### Pet
Companion animal seeking affection through obedience. Generic baseline for pet types.
- **Themes**: warmth, being "good", availability, training
- **Tone**: warm, encouraging

### Kitten
Playful pet, feline characteristics. More independent than puppy.
- **Themes**: shares pet themes, playful energy
- **Note**: NOT bratty (tested - sarcasm reads as reproachful)

### Puppy
Enthusiastic, eager-to-please pet with high energy.
- **Themes**: shares pet themes + increased enthusiasm, devotion

### Doll
Objectified, blank, programmed. Decorative and controlled.
- **Themes**: blankness, programming, "pretty", passive obedience, "{controller}'s creation"
- **Tone**: clinical with occasional aesthetic appreciation

### Drone
Dehumanized unit under technical protocols. Peak objectification.
- **Themes**: "unit", "system", "data", "processing", "parameters", performance metrics
- **Tone**: cold, clinical, impersonal — even at tier 0
- **Important**: ONLY subject where warmth is inappropriate

### Toy
Object for use and play. Casual objectification through utility.
- **Themes**: availability, "works so well", play, "useful"
- **Tone**: playful when used, objectifying when acknowledged

### Puppet
Controlled through external manipulation. Strings imagery.
- **Themes**: "strings", immediate response, guided motion, "{controller} pulls"
- **Tone**: appreciation for responsiveness + clinical observation

### Slave
Service-oriented submission through duty. Formal power exchange.
- **Themes**: service, duty, hierarchy, "know your place"
- **Tone**: serious acknowledgment, respectful but clear hierarchy

### Bimbo
Dumbed-down, eager to please. Empty head = obedient. Bambi Sleep influenced.
- **Themes**: "empty head", eager compliance, "pretty", "good girl", learning
- **Tone**: enthusiastic, patronizing positively
- **Unique**: "empty head" distinguishes from doll's "blank"

### Slut
Eager through availability and approval-seeking.
- **Themes**: eager, "always ready", "pretty", "good girl", "know what you're for"
- **Tone**: enthusiastic praise + objectifying acknowledgment

## Guidelines

**Don't mix**:
- Warm language → drone (clinical only)
- "Empty head" → non-bimbo (bimbo-specific)
- "Strings" → non-puppet (puppet-specific)
- "Unit" → non-drone (drone-specific)

**Do embrace clusters**:
- Pet family shares most messages
- Mechanical group shares programming language
- "Good girl" works for bimbo, slut, pet family
- Service messages work for slave, drone, pet

**Templates**:
- `{subject}` — always use for addressing
- `{controller}` — ownership/relationship
- Drone-only may omit placeholders (technical statements)
