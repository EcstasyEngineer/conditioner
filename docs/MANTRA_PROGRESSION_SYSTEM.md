# Mantra Progression System Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive progression system for the AI Conditioner Discord bot's mantra feature, designed to create an engaging 8-month gameplay loop using optimal gaming psychology principles. The system transforms the current flat theme structure into a deep, interconnected progression tree with 115+ themes from the subspace-studio ontology.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Psychological Hooks**
- **Variable Ratio Reinforcement**: Random "shiny" mantras and bonus events
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear paths showing unlocked and upcoming content
- **Loss Aversion**: Streak protection and "rest days" to prevent burnout
- **Social Proof**: Opt-in leaderboards and achievement showcases
- **Competence Building**: Gradual difficulty increase with clear skill progression

### 2. **Engagement Timeline**
- **Week 1-2**: Onboarding and foundation themes
- **Month 1-2**: Core theme exploration and first unlocks
- **Month 3-4**: Specialization paths and advanced themes
- **Month 5-6**: Mastery challenges and rare content
- **Month 7-8**: Endgame content and prestige systems

## Dual Currency System

### 1. **Compliance XP (CXP)** - Experience/Level Currency
- **Purpose**: Permanent progression tracking, never decreases
- **Sources**: 
  - Completing mantras (current point system)
  - Streak bonuses
  - Achievement completions
  - Daily login bonuses
- **Uses**:
  - Determines user level/rank
  - Gates content by progression tier
  - Unlocks achievement tiers
  - Shows on leaderboards

### 2. **Conditioning Tokens (CT)** - Spendable Currency
- **Purpose**: Economy currency for unlocks and purchases
- **Sources**:
  - Earned alongside CXP at ~50% rate
  - Bonus CT for first completion of each mantra
  - Event rewards and daily challenges
  - Achievement milestone rewards
  - "Prestige" conversion at high levels
- **Uses**:
  - Unlock new themes
  - Purchase pet name upgrades
  - Buy streak protection items
  - Unlock cosmetic options
  - Theme reroll tokens

### Currency Examples:
- Complete a 30-point mantra â†’ Gain 30 CXP + 15 CT
- First time completing that specific mantra â†’ +10 bonus CT
- Daily streak bonus â†’ 50 CXP + 100 CT
- Theme mastery achievement â†’ 500 CXP + 1000 CT

## Current Engagement Statistics

- **Response Times**: Speed bonuses (best times: 12-16s for ultra-fast)
- **Streak Data**: Progressive bonuses up to "Full Synchronization"
- **Theme Usage**: Which themes users engage with most
- **Transmission Rates**: Adaptive frequency (1.0-3.0/day based on engagement)

  - level (calculated from CXP)
  - themes_owned[]
  - pet_names_owned[]
  - items_inventory{}
  - transaction_history[]

economy_transactions:
  - user_id
  - transaction_type
  - amount
  - item_purchased
  - timestamp

mantra_completions:
  - (existing fields)
  - cxp_earned
  - ct_earned
  - bonuses_applied[]
```

### 2. **Migration Plan**
1. Convert existing points â†’ CXP at 1:1 ratio
2. Grant retroactive CT at 50% of CXP earned
3. Give early adopter bonus: 500 CT per active user
4. Grandfather in current pet names as "owned"

### 3. **Balance Considerations**
- CT earning rate ensures steady progression
- Sinks prevent inflation (consumables, rerolls)
- F2P path to all content (time investment)
- No pay-to-win mechanics (cosmetic only monetization if any)

## Example User Journey

**Week 1**: 
- Start with 2 foundation themes
- Earn ~500 CXP + 250 CT
- Buy first pet name upgrade (toy)

**Month 1**:

## Conclusion

The dual currency system solves the "backwards progression" problem while adding economic depth. CXP provides permanent progression satisfaction while CT creates meaningful choices and goals. This system can sustain 8+ months of engaged play with clear short, medium, and long-term objectives.

The economy is designed to be generous enough for steady progress but scarce enough to make purchases meaningful. Every session provides tangible rewards in both currencies, maintaining the dopamine loop while building toward larger goals.
