# Mantra Theme Development Guide

This guide provides best practices and requirements for creating new mantra themes for the hypnotic conditioning system.

## Technical Requirements

### File Structure
```json
{
  "theme": "theme_name",
  "description": "Brief description of the theme's focus",
  "mantras": [
    {
      "text": "The mantra text with {pet_name} and {dominant_title} variables",
      "difficulty": "basic|light|moderate|deep|extreme",
      "base_points": 10-120
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required Elements
1. **Theme name**: lowercase, single word identifier
2. **Description**: 10-20 word summary of the theme
3. **Mantras array**: Minimum 25-30 mantras for variety
4. **Template variables**: 
   - `{pet_name}` - User's chosen pet name
   - `{dominant_title}` - Either "Master" or "Mistress"

### Difficulty Distribution
- **Basic** (10-15 points): 5-6 mantras - Simple affirmations
- **Light** (20-30 points): 5-6 mantras - Slightly deeper suggestions
- **Moderate** (35-45 points): 5-6 mantras - Clear conditioning statements
- **Deep** (60-80 points): 5-6 mantras - Intense psychological elements
- **Extreme** (100-120 points): 5-6 mantras - Complete surrender concepts

#### Normalized Point Values
Based on difficulty analysis, use these specific point values:
- **Basic**: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- **Light**: 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30
- **Moderate**: 35, 38, 40, 42, 45 (avoid 50 - too close to deep)
- **Deep**: 60, 65, 70, 75, 80
- **Extreme**: 100, 105, 110, 115, 120

## Content Guidelines

### 1. Progression Design
Each difficulty level should build naturally:
- **Basic**: Introduction to the concept
- **Light**: Acceptance and normalization
- **Moderate**: Integration and identification
- **Deep**: Core identity modification
- **Extreme**: Total transformation

### 2. Language Patterns

#### Effective Techniques
- **First person**: "I am...", "My mind..."
- **Third person with pet_name**: "{pet_name} becomes...", "{pet_name}'s thoughts..."
- **Present tense**: Creates immediacy
- **Progressive tense**: "becoming", "growing" - implies ongoing change
- **Declarative statements**: State as fact, not possibility

#### Avoid
- Questions or uncertainty ("maybe", "might")
- Past tense (unless referencing transformation)
- Negative framing (use positive statements)
- Gender-specific pronouns (we don't have that variable)

#### Intensity Markers by Difficulty
**Basic**: 
- Simple verbs: enjoy, like, feel, want
- No permanence words
- Gentle introduction: "starting to", "beginning"

**Light**:
- Growth language: growing, building, developing
- Regularity: daily, often, regularly
- Mild compulsion: need, crave (without desperation)

**Moderate**:
- Identity statements: "I am", "becoming my nature"
- Control language: controls, defines, shapes
- Deeper integration but not permanent

**Deep**:
- Consumption: consumed, filled, saturated
- Core/fundamental: "to my core", "fundamental nature"
- Near-complete states: "almost entirely", "nearly total"

**Extreme**:
- Permanence: forever, permanently, irreversibly
- Absolute language: "nothing but", "only exist to", "completely"
- Total transformation: complete override of self

### 3. Theme Consistency
- Every mantra should clearly relate to the core theme
- Use theme-specific vocabulary consistently
- Maintain tonal consistency within difficulty levels
- Ensure natural escalation between levels

### 4. Psychological Impact

#### Basic/Light
- Gentle suggestions
- Positive associations
- Building comfort with concepts

#### Moderate
- Identity statements
- Behavioral modifications
- Deeper psychological connections

#### Deep/Extreme
- Core identity changes
- Permanent mindset shifts
- Complete psychological restructuring

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Theme Research
- Define the core concept in 3-5 words
- List 10-15 keywords associated with the theme
- Consider different angles and interpretations

### Step 2: Difficulty Mapping
Create example mantras for each level first:
```
Basic: "I enjoy [theme concept]"
Light: "[Theme] feels natural for {pet_name}"
Moderate: "I am defined by my [theme]"
Deep: "My entire being is consumed by [theme]"
Extreme: "{pet_name} exists only as [theme] for {dominant_title}"
```

### Step 3: Variation Techniques
For each difficulty level, vary:
- **Perspective**: I/my vs {pet_name}/{pet_name}'s
- **Focus**: Mental vs emotional vs physical
- **Intensity**: Gentle → firm → absolute
- **Scope**: Specific → general → all-encompassing

### Step 4: Template Testing
Check each mantra with different combinations:
- pet_name: puppet, kitten, toy, slave
- dominant_title: Master, Mistress

Ensure natural flow with all combinations.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a theme:

- [ ] 25-30 total mantras minimum
- [ ] Even distribution across difficulties
- [ ] All mantras use proper template variables
- [ ] No gender-specific pronouns
- [ ] Clear progression from basic to extreme
- [ ] Consistent theme throughout
- [ ] Natural language flow
- [ ] Appropriate point values
- [ ] No duplicate concepts
- [ ] Tested with various pet_name/dominant_title combinations

## Example Development Process

**Theme**: Emptiness

1. **Core concept**: Mental void, blank states, becoming empty
2. **Keywords**: blank, void, empty, hollow, clear, space, nothing, peace
3. **Angles**: 
   - Peaceful emptiness
   - Empty to be filled
   - Void of resistance
   - Blank slate
4. **Difficulty progression**:
   - Basic: Introduction to peaceful blank states
   - Light: Emptiness as positive experience
   - Moderate: Identity connecting to emptiness
   - Deep: Fundamental hollowness
   - Extreme: Complete mental void

## Safety Considerations

- Extreme content should be clearly marked
- Consider adding progression gates for intense themes
- Balance intensity with user safety
- Include positive reinforcement where appropriate

## File Management

### Active Themes
- Save as `themename.json` in `/mantras/themes/`
- Will be automatically loaded by the system

### Draft Themes
- Save as `themename.json.draft` 
- Won't be loaded until `.draft` is removed
- Allows testing and review before activation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Have multiple people review for:
   - Typos and grammar
   - Natural flow
   - Appropriate intensity
   - Theme consistency

2. Consider user feedback on:
   - Difficulty progression
   - Point balance
   - Engagement level
   - Comfort with content

3. Run difficulty validation:
   - Use blind comparison tests to verify difficulty ordering
   - Check that intensity markers match assigned difficulties
   - Ensure no overlap between difficulty point ranges

## Normalization Standards

Based on difficulty analysis conducted on the mantra system:

### Key Normalization Rules
1. **Avoid 50-point moderate mantras** - Too close to deep difficulty
2. **All extreme mantras should be 100+ points** - Clear separation from deep
3. **Use standardized point values** per difficulty level (see above)
4. **Reserve permanence language** for extreme difficulty only
5. **Identity statements** belong in moderate or higher

### Common Issues to Avoid
- Don't use "forever", "permanently", "irreversibly" below extreme
- Don't use "nothing but", "only exist to" below extreme  
- Ensure basic mantras use simple, gentle language
- Light mantras should show growth/development, not completion
- Moderate mantras can have identity language but not permanence

### Theme-Specific Calibration
Some themes may need special consideration:
- **Emptiness**: Ensure progression from peaceful to complete void
- **Mindbreak**: Reserve truly broken states for deep/extreme
- **Bimbo**: Keep playful tone even at higher difficulties
- **Addiction**: Build craving intensity gradually

Remember: Quality over quantity. Well-crafted mantras that genuinely engage with the theme create better experiences than generic filler content.
