REMAINING FILES NEEDING STRUCTURAL FIXES:

‚ö†Ô∏è free_use.json - Has "base_difficulty/variance" properties
‚ö†Ô∏è gaslighting.json.draft - Uses multi-line mantra format
‚ö†Ô∏è doll.json.draft - Has structural issues and repetitive content

FILES WITH MINOR ISSUES:
‚ö†Ô∏è Several .json.draft files have "base_difficulty/variance" properties
‚ö†Ô∏è Some files may have inconsistent base_points progression

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix remaining structural issues in worship.json, helplessness.json 
2. Remove "base_difficulty/variance" from active .json files
3. Fix multi-line formatting in gaslighting.json.draft
4. Address doll.json.draft repetitive content issues
5. Perform QA scoring for all themes
6. Create final documentation files

QUALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- doll.json.draft has many repetitive mantras with identical structure
- Some themes have inconsistent point progressions
- Several draft themes need content review for hypnotic effectiveness
